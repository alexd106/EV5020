# the summary statistics to report from this table are the F statistic with both of its

# note that this test only tells you that the five means are not all equal. It doesn't

summary(birds_lm)

# Here the intercept (baseline) is the mean abundance of birds for FGRAZE level 1. the
# null hypothesis for the intercept is that the intercept = 0. As the p value (p <
# 2e-16) is very small we reject this null hypothesis and conclude that the intercept is
# significantly different from 0. However, from a biological perspective this is not a
# particularly informative hypothesis to test. Nobody seriously entertained the idea
# that lightly grazed patches contain no birds at all, so rejecting it tells us nothing
# we didn't already know.

# now for the confidence intervals
confint(birds_lm)

# far more useful is the estimate itself along with its interval. Mean bird abundance in
# graze level 1 is estimated at 28.62 birds (95% CI: 24.49 to 32.75 birds).

# the remaining estimates are differences (contrasts) between each level and the
# baseline. Let's report each one as an estimated difference with an interval, and leave
# the P value until the end of the sentence where it belongs.

# FGRAZE2: we estimate 9.20 fewer birds on average in graze level 2 than in graze level
# 1 (95% CI: 15.30 fewer to 3.11 fewer birds, p = 0.004). The whole interval lies below
# zero, so we have clear evidence of a difference here. But notice how wide it is. A
# shortfall of 3 birds and a shortfall of 15 birds would mean rather different things
# ecologically, and these data can't distinguish between them.

# FGRAZE3: we estimate 8.46 fewer birds in graze level 3 than in graze level 1 (95% CI:
# 13.94 fewer to 2.97 fewer birds, p = 0.003).

# FGRAZE4: we estimate 9.66 fewer birds in graze level 4 than in graze level 1 (95% CI:
# 15.50 fewer to 3.82 fewer birds, p = 0.002).

# FGRAZE5: we estimate 22.33 fewer birds in graze level 5 than in graze level 1 (95% CI:
# 28.17 fewer to 16.49 fewer birds, p = 1.64e-10). This is far and away the largest of
# the four differences, and the entire interval sits well below the intervals for the
# other three contrasts.

# Before going further, be clear about what these four intervals are intervals FOR. They
# are intervals for the DIFFERENCE between a grazing level and graze level 1. They are
# not intervals for the bird abundance of a grazing level. So "-15.30 to -3.11" means
# "graze level 2 has somewhere between 3.11 and 15.30 fewer birds than graze level 1".
# It does not mean "graze level 2 has between 3.11 and 15.30 birds in it". We will get
# intervals for the five levels themselves in Q11, and they are different numbers
# entirely.

# so, which of the four differences is estimated most precisely? Compare the widths of
# the intervals: FGRAZE3 spans 10.97 birds, FGRAZE4 and FGRAZE5 both span 11.68, and
# FGRAZE2 spans 12.20. So the graze 1 versus graze 3 difference is the best estimated of
# the four, and graze 1 versus graze 2 the worst.

# why? Each of these is a comparison between two groups, so how precise it is depends on
# how much data you have in BOTH of them, not just one. Graze level 1 is the baseline
# and so appears in all four comparisons, which means the only thing that varies between
# them is the size of the other group
table(loyn$FGRAZE)

# graze level 3 has 17 patches, levels 4 and 5 have 13 each, and level 2 has only 11.
# The comparison involving the largest group is the tightest and the one involving the
# smallest group is the loosest. Something to bear in mind when you're deciding how to
# spread your effort in your own sampling. A comparison is only ever as good as the
# smaller of the two groups going into it.

# and that's us finished. No need to relevel to graze level 5, as every pair has already
# turned up in one of the four models above.

# Putting all ten pairwise differences together with their intervals, the picture is
# this. Level 1 sits well above the other four, level 5 sits well below the other four,
# and levels 2, 3 and 4 can't be separated from one another by these data.

# One important thing to notice as you work through these. Releveling doesn't change the
# model at all. The fitted values, the residuals, the R^2 and the F test are identical
# every time. All that changes is which set of comparisons R chooses to show you.

# Check this for yourself in the confint() output above. The difference between graze
# levels 2 and 3 is 0.75 birds (95% CI: -5.01 to 6.51) when level 2 is the baseline, and
# -0.75 birds (95% CI: -6.51 to 5.01) when level 3 is. Same comparison, same width of
# interval, sign flipped. That is one result, not two.

# The multiple R-squared value is 0.4915 and therefore 49.2% of the variation in ABUND
# is explained by FGRAZE

# The adjusted R-squared is 0.459. Recall from the previous exercise that the adjusted
# value penalises you for the number of parameters estimated, whereas the multiple
# R-squared can only go up as you add terms.

# The gap between the two is bigger here: 0.033 against 0.006 in the previous exercise.
# That's because this model estimates five parameters (an intercept plus four contrasts)
# rather than two, so there is more to penalise. That is exactly the point of the
# adjustment.

# Since this is still a single explanatory variable model, quoting the multiple
# R-squared is fine, as long as you say which one it is. The moment you start comparing
# models with different numbers of terms, as you will in exercise 4, switch to the
# adjusted value.

# first split the plotting device into 2 rows and 2 columns
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# now create the residuals plots
plot(birds_lm)

# To test the normality of residuals assumption we use the Normal Q-Q plot. Although the
# majority of the residuals lie along the reference line there are five residuals which
# are all below the line resulting in reasonably substantial negative residuals. This
# suggest that the model does not fit these observation very well.

# Looking at the homogeneity of variance assumption (Residuals vs Fitted and
# Scale-Location plot) you can see the five columns of residuals corresponding to the
# fitted values for the five grazing levels. Again, things don't look great. The spread
# for the lower fitted values (left side of the plot) is much narrower when compared to
# the other groups. This suggests that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not met
# (i.e. the variances are not the same). The same cluster of negative residuals we
# spotted in the Normal Q-Q plot also appears in the Residuals vs Fitted plot suggesting
# that it is these residuals that are responsible.

# The only real good news is that there doesn't appear to be any influential or unusual
# residuals as indicated in the Residuals vs Leverage plot.

# So what to do? You could go back and check the original field notebook data to see if
# a transcribing mistake has been made (seems unlikely and you dont have this luxury
# anyway). You could also try applying a transformation (log or square root) on the
# ABUND variable, refit the model and see if this improves things. For example

loyn$ABUND.SQRT <- sqrt(loyn$ABUND)
birds_lm_sqrt <- lm(ABUND.SQRT ~ FGRAZE, data = loyn)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(birds_lm_sqrt)

# Sadly this doesn't seemed to have improved things!

# Or finally, you can relax the assumption of equal variance and estimate a separate
# variance for each group using generalised least squares. This is not something we will
# do on this course but will cover in a more advanced statistics course!

# (a) what are these five intervals?

# They are 95% confidence intervals for the MEAN bird abundance within each of the five
# grazing levels. There are five of them because there are five groups.

# In Q7 you only got four intervals from confint(). (Note that summary() never gives you
# intervals at all, only estimates and standard errors. It's confint() that turns those
# into intervals.) There were four because those are contrasts, i.e. DIFFERENCES from
# the baseline, and a set of five groups only has four differences from a baseline.
# Nothing has gone missing.

# here are the five group means and their intervals written out
round(data.frame(FGRAZE = 1:5,
                 mean   = pred_vals$fit,
                 lower  = pred_vals$fit - 1.96 * pred_vals$se.fit,
                 upper  = pred_vals$fit + 1.96 * pred_vals$se.fit), 2)

# Take graze level 2. On this plot it is 19.42 birds (15.02 to 23.82). From confint() in
# Q7, the FGRAZE2 contrast was -9.20 (-15.30 to -3.11).

# Let's spell both of those out carefully in words.

#   plot     : "the MEAN abundance of patches at graze level 2 is estimated at
#              19.4 birds, and these data are consistent with a mean anywhere
#              between 15.0 and 23.8 birds"

#   confint(): "the MEAN abundance at graze level 2 is estimated at 9.2 birds
#              LOWER than at graze level 1, and these data are consistent with a
#              difference anywhere between 3.1 and 15.3 birds lower"

# Note that both statements are about the MEAN of a group, not about individual patches.
# An interval of 15.0 to 23.8 does NOT say that 95% of graze level 2 patches hold
# between 15 and 24 birds. Plenty of individual patches sit well outside that range, as
# you can see from the raw data. It says the group AVERAGE is somewhere in there.
# Getting this wrong is one of the most common errors in reporting, so read that
# sentence twice.

# Both statements are true and both are useful, but they answer different questions and
# you must never quote one when you mean the other.

# graze level 1 is the one place the two agree. We get 28.62 birds (24.57 to 32.67) here
# against an intercept of 28.62 (24.49 to 32.75) from confint(), because the intercept
# IS the mean of graze level 1. The last decimal differs only because confint() uses the
# t distribution with 62 degrees of freedom, a multiplier of 2.00, while our plotting
# code above uses 1.96.


# (b) overlap, and this is the one that really matters

# The rule works in one direction only.

# If two intervals do NOT overlap, those two means are clearly different (the difference
# between them would have a P value below 0.05). That direction is safe.

# If two intervals DO overlap, you cannot conclude anything from that. In particular you
# must not conclude that the two means are the same, or even that the difference isn't
# 'significant'. Two intervals can overlap quite noticeably while the difference between
# those two means still has a confidence interval that comfortably excludes zero.

# The reason is that the uncertainty in a difference is smaller than the two
# uncertainties added together. So the interval for a difference is narrower than you'd
# guess by eye from the two intervals for the means, and judging by overlap alone makes
# you far too cautious. You end up reporting 'no difference' for comparisons that were
# perfectly well resolved.

# In these particular data the two views do happen to agree, and every pair of grazing
# levels whose difference is clearly resolved also has non-overlapping intervals. Don't
# take that as reassurance though, it's a fluke of this dataset and not a rule.

# So what should you actually do? Use a plot like this to show your reader the overall
# pattern, because it does that far better than a table of contrasts ever will. But when
# you want to make a claim about one particular comparison, quote the confidence
# interval for that DIFFERENCE, which is what Q7 gave you, and not the two intervals for
# the means.

## ----Q12, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Same health warning as the previous exercise. This is my version, not the only
# version.

# Mean bird abundance differed among the five grazing intensity levels (F 4,62 = 14.98,
# p < 0.001, n = 67 patches). Abundance was highest at the lowest grazing intensity
# (mean 28.6 birds, 95% CI: 24.5 to 32.8) and lowest at the highest intensity (mean 6.3
# birds), a difference of 22.3 birds (95% CI: 16.5 to 28.2). Grazing levels 2, 3 and 4
# were similar to one another (means 19.4, 20.2 and 19.0 birds) and all sat roughly 8 to
# 10 birds below level 1. The effect is therefore not a smooth decline across the
# grazing gradient, it's concentrated at the highest grazing intensity. Grazing
# intensity accounted for 49.2% of the variation in bird abundance. The residual plots
# in Question 10 showed that the variance was not equal across the five grazing levels,
# so these intervals should be treated as approximate.

# That last sentence matters. We found a problem with the homogeneity of variance
# assumption back in Q10 and then carried on and reported the model anyway, which is a
# perfectly reasonable thing to do as long as you say so. What you must not do is find a
# problem in your model validation and then quietly leave it out of the write up.

# One thing I left out on purpose is the P value for the intercept (p < 2e-16). That
# tests the hypothesis "there are no birds at all in the least grazed patches", which
# nobody believed and nobody needed testing. A perfectly good statistical result can
# still be biologically pointless, and a fair part of writing up well is deciding what
# to leave out.
