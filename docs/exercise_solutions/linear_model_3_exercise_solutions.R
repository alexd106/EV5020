# The plot of the residuals against the fitted values suggests these extreme residuals

# Looking at the homogeneity of variance assumption (Residuals vs Fitted and

# WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR HERE? Not an overall trend. If a variable is in the

# like. cor(loyn$resid_inter, loyn$LOGAREA) comes out as zero (near enough, R
# will report something like -9.9e-18) and the mean residual is zero within
# every level of FGRAZE.

# What these plots CAN show you is shape and spread.

# Against LOGAREA: the scatter is fairly even across the range with no obvious
# curve, so there is no sign that we need a quadratic term for patch area.

# Against FGRAZE: the middle of each box sits on zero, as it must, but the boxes
# are not the same height. Graze level 3 is much more variable than graze levels
# 2 and 4. The residual variances are 21.8, 10.3, 48.5, 6.1 and 12.0, so the
# largest is about eight times the smallest. That's a hint that the homogeneity
# of variance assumption is shakier than the Scale-Location plot made it look.

# This means that there is a significant relationship between bird abundance and log
# area, and that this relationship is different for different levels of graze (at least
# one of them is different). Put another way, the slopes of the relationship between
# abundance and log area for each level of graze are different.

# As there is a significant interaction, it's difficult to interpret the main effects of

summary(birds_inter1)

# and the 95% confidence intervals for each of those estimates
confint(birds_inter1)

# One thing first, and it's the same point we made in the previous exercise. Apart from
# the intercept and LOGAREA, every estimate in this table is a DIFFERENCE. FGRAZE2 is
# not graze level 2's intercept, it is how different graze level 2's intercept is from
# graze level 1's. FGRAZE2:LOGAREA is not graze level 2's slope, it is how different
# that slope is from graze level 1's. To get the actual intercept and slope for a
# grazing level, add the relevant contrast onto the baseline:

#   graze level 2 intercept = 21.24 + (-6.06) = 15.18
#   graze level 2 slope     =  4.14 +   4.27  =  8.41

# Keep graze level 1's own slope of 4.14 in mind as you read on. Several of the
# differences below are measured against it and they only make sense once you can see
# how small it is.

# (Intercept) Here the Intercept (baseline) is the predicted ABUND when LOGAREA = 0, for
# FGRAZE level 1. Note that LOGAREA = 0 is a patch of 1 hectare (because log10(1) = 0),
# so this is a real patch size and not an extrapolation. We estimate 21.24 birds (95%
# CI: 14.37 to 28.12 birds). the null hypothesis for the intercept is that the intercept
# = 0 As the P value < 0.05 (7.09e-08) we reject this null hypothesis, although 'are
# there no birds at all in a one hectare patch?' was never a question that anyone needed
# answering.

# LOGAREA Represents the slope of the relationship between ABUND and LOGAREA, specific
# to FGRAZE = 1. The null hypothesis is that the slope of the relationship between
# LOGAREA and ABUND = 0, for level FGRAZE = 1 only. So, for graze 1 the slope is 4.14.
# This means that for a 1 unit increase in LOGAREA (i.e. a tenfold increase in patch
# area) we get a corresponding increase of 4.14 birds on average (95% CI: 0.60 to 7.69
# birds). As the P value (0.022) is < 0.05 we conclude that the slope is different from
# 0. Notice how wide that interval is though. These data are consistent with anything
# from a barely detectable increase of 0.6 birds up to a substantial 7.7 birds. So we're
# reasonably confident about the direction of this effect but not at all confident about
# its size.

# FGRAZE2 The difference between the intercept of graze level 2 and that of graze level
# 1. The null hypothesis is that this difference = 0. In a one hectare patch, graze
# level 2 is estimated to hold 6.06 fewer birds than graze level 1 (95% CI: -13.72 to
# +1.60, p = 0.118). The interval includes zero, so we fail to reject the null
# hypothesis.

# Stop there though. Do NOT go on to say the two are 'the same'. Look at what this
# interval still allows, anything from 13.7 fewer birds to 1.6 more. Nearly 14 fewer
# birds is a bigger difference than the raw gap between these two grazing levels in the
# previous exercise (9.2 birds), so this is not some small possibility we're brushing
# aside.

# With only 11 patches at graze level 2 this is a precision problem, not a null result.
# The honest conclusion is 'these data can't tell us', and that's a perfectly legitimate
# thing to report.

# FGRAZE3, FGRAZE4, FGRAZE5
# Same interpretation as FGRAZE2: each is the difference in intercept from
# graze level 1.
# FGRAZE3: -12.32 birds (95% CI: -20.77 to -3.88, p = 0.005)
# FGRAZE4: -15.41 birds (95% CI: -24.65 to -6.17, p = 0.001)
# FGRAZE5: -17.04 birds (95% CI: -24.64 to -9.44, p < 0.001)
# All three intervals lie entirely below zero, so here we do have clear
# evidence of lower abundance than at graze level 1. But notice how wide they
# still are. We know the direction, and that all three reductions are
# substantial, but we don't know the size to better than about 15 birds either way.

# FGRAZE2:LOGAREA This represents the difference in the slope of the relationship
# between ABUND and LOGAREA between graze level 2 and graze level 1. The null hypothesis
# is that the difference in slopes between graze level 1 and 2 = 0 (i.e. no difference).
# The estimated difference in slopes is 4.27 (95% CI: -0.56 to 9.10, p = 0.082). The
# interval includes zero, so no clear evidence that the slopes differ, and once again
# that's not the same as saying they are the same. Graze level 1's own slope is only
# 4.14, so an interval reaching 9.10 is consistent with graze level 2 responding to
# patch area more than twice as steeply.

# FGRAZE3:LOGAREA This represents the difference in the slope of the relationship
# between ABUND and LOGAREA between graze level 3 and graze level 1. The null hypothesis
# is that the difference in slopes between graze level 1 and 3 = 0 (i.e. no difference).
# The estimated difference in slopes is 9.06 (95% CI: 2.89 to 15.22) with a P value of
# 0.005. The whole interval lies above zero, so we do have clear evidence that the
# relationship between bird abundance and patch area is steeper in graze level 3 than it
# is in graze level 1.

# FGRAZE4:LOGAREA Same interpretation again: the estimated difference in slopes between
# graze level 4 and graze level 1 is 13.63 (95% CI: 5.33 to 21.94, p = 0.002). The whole
# interval is above zero, so we have clear evidence of a steeper relationship in graze
# level 4 than in graze level 1, and this is the largest slope difference in the model.

# FGRAZE5:LOGAREA The estimated difference in slopes between graze level 5 and graze
# level 1 is 2.00 (95% CI: -4.30 to 8.29, p = 0.528). With a P value that unremarkable
# it's very tempting to write this off as 'no difference'. But the interval runs from
# 4.3 shallower than graze level 1's slope to 8.3 steeper, against a graze level 1 slope
# of only 4.14. So these data are consistent with graze level 5 having essentially no
# relationship with patch area, and just as consistent with it having one three times
# steeper. We've learned almost nothing here, which is a very different thing from
# having learned there's nothing there.

# One general point before you move on. Parameters whose intervals exclude zero and
# those whose intervals include it are not two different kinds of result. They sit on a
# continuum of evidence. FGRAZE2:LOGAREA (p = 0.08) and FGRAZE3:LOGAREA (p = 0.005)
# differ in degree, not in kind.

# The Multiple R-square value is 0.80, so 80% of the variation in the data is explained
# by the model. This is quite a bit more than the models with only LOGAREA and FGRAZE as
# single explanatory variables. Remember though that R-squared tells you how well this
# model fits these data and nothing more than that.

## ----Q10, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Same health warning as before. This is my version, not the only version.

# The relationship between bird abundance and forest patch area depended on grazing
# intensity (interaction F 4,57 = 4.09, p = 0.006; adjusted R2 = 0.77, n = 67 patches).
# Abundance increased with patch area at every grazing level, but the rate of increase
# varied more than fourfold, from 4.1 birds per tenfold increase in area at the lowest
# grazing intensity to 17.8 at grazing level 4 (Fig. 1). In a one hectare patch,
# abundance at grazing level 2 was an estimated 6.1 birds lower than at level 1 (95% CI:
# 13.7 lower to 1.6 higher) and its slope 4.3 steeper (95% CI: 0.6 shallower to 9.1
# steeper). With only 11 patches at that grazing level these data cannot resolve either
# comparison. Patch area therefore mattered least in the most lightly grazed patches,
# which already held high numbers of birds even when small, and most at intermediate to
# high grazing intensities. Residual spread differed among grazing levels (Q6), so the
# intervals reported here should be treated as approximate.

# Note that last sentence. We turned up a problem with the equal variance assumption
# back in Q6 and then went ahead and reported the model anyway. That's fine, as long as
# you tell your reader you did it. Finding something in your model validation and then
# leaving it out of the write up is not fine.

# Right, so what's going on in that paragraph? Let's take my three questions in turn.

# 1. No, you can't write that sentence on its own, and this is the big one.

#    Once you have an interaction in the model, "bird abundance increases with
#    patch area" is only half a sentence, because HOW MUCH it increases depends
#    on the grazing level. The honest version always carries the condition with
#    it, something like "abundance increased with patch area at every grazing
#    level, but the rate varied fourfold". Never let a main effect out on its
#    own when it sits inside an interaction.

# 2. Look at the two clauses in the middle of my paragraph.

#    They give the estimate, they give the interval, and then they say plainly
#    that we can't resolve the comparison. What they never do is claim the two
#    grazing levels are the same. I've also told the reader WHY we can't
#    resolve it (only 11 patches), which turns 'we don't know' from something
#    that sounds like a failure into a useful piece of information about the
#    study. "We cannot tell from these data" is a perfectly respectable result
#    and it is perfectly publishable.

# 3. No, and let's be clear about why not.

#    It is NOT that the baseline is uninteresting. Graze level 1 is the lightest
#    grazing intensity, so it's a perfectly sensible reference to compare the
#    others against, and a reader will care about it. The problem is simply that
#    ten numbers written out in prose is unreadable. Nobody can hold five
#    intercepts and five slopes in their head from a block of text.

#    So report the interaction test, the range of fitted slopes, the figure,
#    and the adjusted R2 and n, then let your figure do the heavy lifting. If a
#    journal wants the full coefficient table it goes in a supplement. Your
#    figure from Q9 will always tell your reader more than the table does, as
#    five fitted lines whose slopes visibly differ IS the finding.

# Two last things I did on purpose, which you might want to copy.

# I said 'adjusted R2' rather than just 'R2'. With 10 parameters the two differ
# noticeably here (0.80 against 0.77), and your reader can't check your number if they
# don't know which one you quoted.

# I wrote 'per tenfold increase in area' rather than 'per unit log10 area'. Both are
# correct, but only one of them means anything to an ecologist reading in a hurry.
# Wherever you've transformed a variable, try to hand your reader the effect back on a
# scale they can picture.
