# No, not all of the P values are less than 0.05, which is what prompts us to simplify
# the model over the next few questions.

# And the question about chance? At a 0.05 threshold you expect about 1 test in every 20
# to fall below it even when nothing at all is going on. So in a table of 14 tests you'd
# expect roughly one 'significant' result even if none of these variables mattered in
# the slightest. Bear that in mind whenever somebody hands you a big table of tests. A
# single starred coefficient in a table this size is weak evidence on its own, and
# hunting through a big model for whatever happens to sit below 0.05 is a poor way to do
# science.

# It's also part of the reason the selection procedure we're about to use follows a
# stated rule, applied consistently, rather than picking out whatever happens to look
# interesting.


## ----Q5, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wait: why can't we use information from the 'summary(M1)' or 'anova(M1)' functions to
# do this?

# the 'summary' table tests if the coefficient for each explanatory variable is
# significantly different from zero.

# the 'anova' tests for the significance of the proportion of variation explained by a
# particular term in the model.

# The ANOVA table also allows testing the overall significance of a categorical
# explanatory variable (like FGRAZE) which involves several parameters together (one for
# each level), which is quite handy. But the results of this ANOVA are based on
# sequential sums of squares and therefore the order of the variables in the model
# (which is arbitrary here) matters.

# We could change the order but there are too many possible permutations. Summary P
# values don't suffer from this problem but test different hypotheses. It would be
# useful to use an ANOVA that doesn't depend on the order of inclusion of the variables,
# this is effectively what 'drop1' does.

drop1(M1, test = "F")

# LOGLDIST is the least significant (p = 0.88), and therefore makes the least

## ----Q10, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# As the interaction between LOGAREA and FGRAZE was significant at each step of model
# selection process the main effects should be left in our model, irrespective of
# significance. This is because it is quite difficult to interpret an interaction
# without the main effects. The drop1 function is clever enough that it doesn't let you
# see the P values for the main effects, in the presence of their significant
# interaction.

# Also note, because R always includes interactions *after* their main effects the P
# value of the interaction term (p = 0.006) from the model selection is the same as P
# value if we use the anova() function on our final model

# Check this:

# and remember from the previous exercise that everything here except the intercept and
# LOGAREA is a DIFFERENCE from graze level 1, not a value for that grazing level. If you
# want the intercept and slope for a particular grazing level you need to add the
# relevant contrast onto the baseline.

# Biologically: confirming what we already found out in the previous exercise: the
# relationship between bird abundance and patch area depends on the level of grazing
# (interaction F_4,57 = 4.09, p = 0.006). The fitted slopes range from 4.14 birds per 1
# unit increase in LOGAREA at graze level 1 up to 17.78 at graze level 4, so the effect
# of patch area varies roughly fourfold across the grazing levels. No single number
# describes 'the effect of area' in these data

# However, some observations are poorly predicted (fitted) using the set of available
# explanatory variables (i.e. the two very large forest patches)

# Interpretation: Bird abundance might increase with patch area due to populations being
# more viable in large patches (e.g. less prone to extinction), or perhaps because there
# is proportionally less edge effect in larger patches, and this in turn provides more
# high quality habitat for species associated with these habitat patches

# The negative effect of grazing may be due to grazing decreasing resource availability
# for birds, for example plants or seeds directly, or insects associated with the grazed
# plants. There may also be more disturbance of birds in highly grazed forest patches
# resulting in fewer foraging opportunities or chances to mate (this is all speculation
# mind you!).

# Methodologically: Model selection is difficult without expert knowledge of the system
# to guide which variables to include in the first place. Plenty of other models could
# have been formulated from this dataset. Theory might have suggested an interaction
# between YR.ISOL and LOGDIST, for instance, since distance affects dispersal between
# patches and time since isolation affects how much dispersal has mattered.

# AND NOW THAT CAVEAT, which is the answer to the question at the end of Q11.

# The P values and confidence intervals printed for M5 are too optimistic.

# They're calculated as if we had specified M5 in advance. We didn't. We fitted a 14
# parameter model and then dropped terms one at a time based on what these same data
# told us. Selection kept exactly those terms that happened to look strongest in this
# particular sample, so the surviving estimates get pushed away from zero and their
# intervals come out narrower than they should be.

# This is known as post-selection inference. There are ways of dealing with it, none of
# which we'll cover here. What matters for you is that the problem exists and that you
# say so plainly whenever you report a model you arrived at by selection. Most published
# papers using stepwise selection don't.

# One thing to be clear about before you go on. You'll have noticed that the model we
# ended up with here is the same one we fitted in the previous exercise. That's down to
# how I set these exercises up, it's not a finding. In the previous exercise I simply
# told you to fit LOGAREA + FGRAZE + LOGAREA:FGRAZE, on the assumption that this was the
# hypothesis the researchers set out to test, because it was the clearest way to show
# you what an interaction between a continuous and a categorical variable looks like.

# So don't read anything into the two agreeing, and in your own work you wouldn't fit
# both and then compare them. You either specify a model in advance from your hypotheses
# and report that, or you select one from the data and report the selection with the
# caveat above. Doing both on the same data and then picking whichever you prefer is the
# one thing neither approach allows.


## ----Q12report, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Same health warning. This is my version, not the only version.

# METHODS. Bird abundance was modelled against log10 patch area, log10 distance to the
# nearest patch, log10 distance to the nearest larger patch, year of isolation, altitude
# and grazing intensity (a five level factor), plus the area by grazing interaction.
# Distance and area variables were log10 transformed after graphical exploration showed
# strong right skew. Terms were removed by backward selection using single term
# deletions and F tests, with main effects retained wherever they appeared in a retained
# interaction.

# RESULTS. Four terms were removed in turn, leaving patch area, grazing intensity and
# their interaction (Table 1). Bird abundance increased with patch area at every grazing
# level, but at a rate that varied more than fourfold with grazing intensity
# (interaction F 4,57 = 4.09, p = 0.006; adjusted R2 = 0.77, n = 67 patches). As this
# model was arrived at by selection rather than specified in advance, the P values and
# intervals reported here are likely to be optimistic.

# (that's about 150 words, so there was room to spare)

# Don't cut that last sentence. It's one of the two things Q12 asked you to include, and
# without it your reader has no way of knowing that the model was searched for rather
# than proposed. It costs you 20 words. If a supervisor or reviewer tells you to drop
# it, ask them what your reader is supposed to do instead.

# Notice how much the table did for us there. Without it you'd have had to spell out
# every deletion and its P value in prose, which would eat most of your word limit and
# be tedious to read. With it, one bracketed "(Table 1)" points your reader at the whole
# selection history and your text is free to say what the result actually means. This is
# how model selection should be reported, and it's not how most papers do it.

# The two things a naive account would have left out are the selection history and that
# last sentence. Without the history your reader can't tell how much searching went on,
# and a model reported bare looks as though it was specified in advance on theoretical
# grounds, which carries far more weight than one arrived at by trying things and
# discarding them. Without the caveat they'd take the P values at face value.

# We will start with a reasonably complex but PLAUSIBLE model (this is the same model we

# increase in AIC (238.02 - 228.20 = 9.82) so this suggests that there is substantial
# evidence that the interaction should remain in the model. The models without
# `LOGLDIST`, `LOGDIST`, `YR.ISOL` all have pretty much the same AIC value (around 226)
# so in practice we could remove any of them. Let's remove the term that results in the
# model with the lowest AIC which is the `LOGLDIST` variable (AIC 226.23).

M2.AIC <- update(M.start.AIC, formula = . ~ . - LOGLDIST)

## ----QA4, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# So, now the model without `LOGDIST` has the lowest AIC (222.43) so we should refit the
# model without this variable and run `drop1()` again.

M4.AIC <- update(M3.AIC, formula = . ~ . - LOGDIST)
drop1(M4.AIC)




## ----QA5, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, results=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# And the model without the variable `ALT` has an AIC of 221.57 which is about the same
# as the model with `ALT` (AIC 222.43), so let's remove this variable from the model as
# this suggests that the simpler model fits our data just as well as the more
# complicated model.

M5.AIC <- update(M4.AIC, formula = . ~ . - ALT)
drop1(M5.AIC)

# OK, so now we have a model with the main effects of LOGAREA, FGRAZE and the
# interaction term LOGAREA:FGRAZE. When we remove the interaction term the AIC value
# increases by 8.9 (230.47-221.57) and this suggests that if we remove the interaction
# term the model fit is significantly worse. Therefore we should leave it in and finish
# our model selection here.
