# The p value is very small (3.81e-14) therefore we reject this null hypothesis (i.e.

# the estimate of the intercept = 10.4 the estimate of the slope = 9.78

# the estimates on their own tell you nothing about how precisely we've measured them,
# so let's also get their 95% confidence intervals
confint(loyn_lm)

# the 95% confidence interval for the slope is 7.76 to 11.81. In words, for every 1 unit
# increase in LOGAREA these data are consistent with an increase of somewhere between
# about 7.8 and 11.8 birds (and a 1 unit increase in LOGAREA is a tenfold increase in
# patch area on the original scale). Our best estimate is 9.78 birds, but it's the
# interval that tells us how precisely we've measured it.

# notice that both ends of this interval describe a substantial effect (bird abundance
# in these data ranges from 1.5 to 39.6 birds), so our ecological conclusion, that
# forest patch area matters and matters a lot, holds right across the whole interval.
# This one is nicely resolved. You'll meet a much messier one in the linear model 3
# exercise.

# the 95% confidence interval for the intercept is 8.05 to 12.76. The intercept is the
# predicted bird abundance when LOGAREA = 0, which is a patch of 1 hectare (because
# log10(1) = 0), so these data are consistent with somewhere between about 8 and 13
# birds in a one hectare patch.


## ----Q6, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# the null hypothesis for the intercept is that the intercept = 0 the p value is very
# small (certainly less than the (not so magic) 0.05) therefore we reject this null
# hypothesis and conclude that the intercept is different from zero.

# the null hypothesis for the slope is that the slope = 0 the p value is very small
# (3.81e-14) therefore we reject this null hypothesis and conclude that the slope is
# different from zero.

# VERSION 2, leading with the estimates instead

# Bird abundance increases with forest patch area. We estimate an increase of 9.78 birds
# (95% CI: 7.76 to 11.81) for every 1 unit increase in LOGAREA (i.e. for every tenfold
# increase in patch area). In a one hectare patch we estimate a bird abundance of 10.41
# birds (95% CI: 8.05 to 12.76).

# Now compare the two. Version 1 tells a reader one thing only, that we were able to
# detect these effects at all. Version 2 tells them by how much bird abundance changes,
# in what units, and how precisely we've measured it.

# You can't get that last part from version 1 at all. A reader of version 2 can see that
# the slope could plausibly be as low as 7.8 or as high as 11.8 birds, and can decide
# for themselves whether an effect of that size matters ecologically. Version 1 gives
# them no way of asking that question.


## ----Q7, eval=SOLUTIONS, echo=SOLUTIONS, collapse=TRUE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
summary(loyn_lm)

# The multiple R-squared value is 0.588 and therefore 58.8% of the variation in ABUND is
# explained by LOGAREA

# WHICH ONE SHOULD YOU QUOTE?

# Multiple R-squared is simply the proportion of the variation in the response that this
# model accounts for. The problem with it is that it can only ever go up when you add
# another explanatory variable, even a completely useless one, because any extra
# variable will mop up a little variation by chance alone.

# Adjusted R-squared applies a penalty for the number of parameters estimated, so it can
# go down when you add a variable that isn't earning its place. That makes it the one to
# use whenever you want to compare models with different numbers of explanatory
# variables.

# Here the two are 0.588 and 0.582, almost identical, because the penalty is tiny when
# there's only one explanatory variable and 67 observations. For a simple model like
# this one, quote the multiple R-squared and say which one it is. Once you get to the
# multiple regression in exercise 4, report the adjusted value.

# Whichever you quote, always say which. 'R-squared = 0.59' on its own is ambiguous, and
# your reader can't check your arithmetic against a number they can't identify.

# One word of caution that applies to both. R-squared measures how well the model fits
# these data and nothing more. A high R-squared doesn't mean that the relationship is
# important, that LOGAREA causes the change in ABUND, or that the model would predict
# well for a new set of forest patches. Equally, a low R-squared doesn't mean that an
# effect is unimportant, as plenty of real and useful effects sit inside very noisy
# systems.

# first split the plotting device into 2 rows and 2 columns
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# now create the residuals plots
plot(loyn_lm)

# The normal Q-Q plot is used to assess normality of the residuals (top right). If
# perfectly normal then all residuals would lie exactly on the reference line. In
# reality this is never going to happen so we are looking for obvious large departures.
# In this plot they don't look too bad, although the lower quantiles do seem to deviate.
# All in all I would be cautiously optimistic.

# To check homogeneity of variance assumption we look at both the Residuals vs Fitted
# (top left) and the Scale-Location plots (bottom left). There doesn't appear to be any
# obvious patterns of the residuals in these plots, although you can see the two
# residuals associated with the two large forest patch areas are below the zero line
# (negative residuals) on the right hand side of these plots despite the log
# transformation. Perhaps something to bear in mind as we progress. But in short, the
# homogeneity of variance assumption looks ok.

# From the Residuals vs Leverage plot (bottom right) you can see that there are no
# residuals with a Cook's distance greater than 1. In fact they are all well below 0.5.
# If you want to produce a plot of just Cook's distance (perhaps this is clearer)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
plot(loyn_lm, which = 4)

# Going back to the Residuals vs Leverage plot (bottom right) you can see three
# residuals that are somewhat unusual in terms of their leverage as they stick out a bit
# to the right compared to the rest of the residuals. Two of these residuals are our two
# large forest patch areas again. However, leverage still seems to be on the low side,
# so at least on the scale of the log transformation things look ok.

# Before you read mine, a health warning. This is how I'd write it up and it's one

# between subfields and between supervisors. What matters is that the estimate, its
# uncertainty and the sample size are all in there, that you haven't claimed anything
# the data don't support, and that somebody could reproduce what you did from what
# you've written. Compare yours against mine, and against the papers you're reading.
# Where they differ, ask yourself which is clearer and which is more honest.

# Bird abundance increased with forest patch area. A linear model of bird abundance
# against log10 transformed patch area estimated an increase of 9.78 birds (95% CI: 7.76
# to 11.81) for every 1 unit increase in log10 area, which is a tenfold increase in
# patch area (F 1,65 = 92.85, p < 0.001). The model explained 58.8% of the variation in
# bird abundance (n = 67 patches).

# Notice that two of those numbers didn't come from summary(). The confidence interval
# came from confint() and you had to go and look the sample size up. Always give n. Two
# studies reporting the same estimate with n = 67 and n = 6700 are not making the same

# the model doesn't look too great now! The fit is poor at both ends. Those 4 to 8
# hectare patches holding 24 to 28 birds are under-predicted by about 8 birds, and on
# this plot they're squashed against the left hand axis where they're easy to miss.

# Notice the gap too. Patches run from 0.1 to 144 hectares and then jump to 973 and
# 1771, so the right hand half of this plot rests on just two points (the same two that
# had high leverage in Q8) and the line across it is an assumption. You could restrict
# the analysis to the smaller patches, which is defensible if your question is really
# about small remnants, but it doesn't fix the poor fit at the low end, the gap is much
# less severe on the log10 scale the model is actually fitted on, and dropping data
# because a plot looks wrong is a decision you'd have to declare.

# And here's the thing we promised you back in Q5. The fitted line is straight on the
# log scale but curved here, so there's no single 'birds per hectare' slope to quote. A
# hectare added to a 1 hectare patch is worth about 2.9 birds, a hectare added to a 1000
# hectare patch about 0.004. What stays the same is the multiplicative step, 9.78 birds
# per tenfold increase in area, which is why we reported the estimate per 1 unit of
# LOGAREA in Q5.
